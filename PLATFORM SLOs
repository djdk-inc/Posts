PLATFORM SLOs

THIS IS A DOCUMENT

This is a test  


In a large-ish organization you're going to need SLOs, heres a couple layers to think about

PRODUCT - ? 
APPLICATION - ?
SERVICE - MONOLITH
AUX - MEMGRAPH
DATA - NATS
CORE - KONG, etc
INFRA - GKE

SLOs are thought of differently at each layer so we're going to approach one layer at a time

What you care about are different at each layer

Interfaces...so



How do you define availability at a layer?
How do you define E2E availability?
