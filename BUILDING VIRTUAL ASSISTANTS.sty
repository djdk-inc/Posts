Think of a workflow that mixes humans and agentic systems like a relay race where the baton sometimes has to be checked, polished, or even questioned before the next sprint. The trick is structuring the handoffs clearly. Here’s a way to frame it:
1. Define decision boundaries.
Agents are great at crunching, retrieving, drafting, and running deterministic steps. Humans are better at judgment calls, trade-offs, and recognizing fuzzy context. In a workflow doc, explicitly mark which steps are "agent-owned" and which are "human-reviewed." Example: “Agent generates candidate rollout plan → Human validates risk tolerance.”
2. Insert intervention gates.
Don’t sprinkle human checks everywhere—that kills flow. Instead, set gates at moments of uncertainty, like when risk is high, ambiguity spikes, or values/tradeoffs must be balanced. Think of them as “review checkpoints” in a flowchart.
3. Keep context portable.
When an agent hands off to a human, the baton should carry the full story—summaries, evidence, options, risks—so the human doesn’t waste time reconstructing. When the human hands it back, the agent should get a structured decision (approve/decline, chosen option, comments).
4. Use escalation paths.
If the agent hits an exception or confidence threshold drops below a line, it should auto-route to human review. Likewise, humans should be able to bounce things back to the agent (“regenerate with different constraints”).
5. Track provenance.
Maintain a log of which steps were agent-executed vs. human-validated. That way you can audit the workflow, and also tune it: maybe you’ll find some “human gates” that never catch anything and can be automated later.
6. Standardize formats.
Agents love structure. Define forms, templates, or schemas for both sides so handoffs don’t turn into messy paragraphs. E.g. agents produce a JSON decision packet, humans fill a simple approval form.
7. Think of it as choreography, not a checklist.
The goal is flow: agents do fast mechanical dances, humans step in for improvisation, then step back out. Too many interventions and the music stops, too few and you risk a runaway machine.
The fun part is you can diagram this as a swimlane chart: one lane for agents, one lane for humans, with “gates” as crossing points. That makes it crystal clear who’s holding the baton and when.
Want me to sketch out a concrete example—say, for a software deployment pipeline where agents handle CI/CD but humans intervene on risky rollouts?
