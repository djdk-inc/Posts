OPERATIONS IN AN AGENTIC WORLD

SRE attitude - autoatmoin
now we have agents


We can't rely on agents
dry MODE



What changes?
- realistic unmocked sandbox environments
- dry-run modes
- shadow systems 

How to handle (un) deterministic behaviour wrt AI operations? 

How is this different from any other scripting we've done before?

How is this different from standard development?
A. The black box, long feedback loop and higher risk surface

How to handle long chained sequences of operations
ex. a rollout 

How to manage large numbers of heterogenous data sources and then making go/no-go decision

How to consolidate information and refine it to a decision quality 

Concrete example

Human intervention at every step - escape hatch (drop-in)

Live agentic review and processing

Returning to a saved state

Look at a bunch of tests, dashboards, metrics/logs, values...
Check for dangerous blips...
Go/No-Go decision

Risk analysis

Rollbacks
